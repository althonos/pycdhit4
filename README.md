## 🗺️ Overview

[CD-HIT](https://sites.google.com/view/cd-hit) is a fast method published in
2006 by Weizhong Li[\[1\]](#ref1) for clustering biological sequences. 
Its clustering approach uses a greedy clustering algorithm and common word counting 
to approximate sequence identity. Extensive parallelization later implemented by 
Limin Fu[\[2\]](#ref2) allow for a quasi-linear speed-up for up to 8 CPU cores, 
a typical figure for consumer hardware.

PyCDHIT is a Python module that provides bindings to CD-HIT
using [Cython](https://cython.org/). It implements a user-friendly, Pythonic
interface to cluster biological sequences using different parameters and access
results directly. It interacts with the CD-HIT library interface, which has
the following advantages:

- **single dependency**: PyCDHIT is distributed as a Python package, so you
  can add it as a dependency to your project, and stop worrying about the
  CD-HIT binaries being present on the end-user machine.
- **no intermediate files**: Everything happens in memory, through Python 
  objects you control, so you don't have to invoke the CD-HIT CLI using a
  sub-process and temporary files.
- **custom alignment parameters**: The pairwise alignment can receive custom
  parameters rather than the default CD-HIT ones, including custom scoring 
  matrices from the [`scoring-matrices`](https://scoring-matrices.readthedocs.io)
  library.

### 📋 Features

PyCDHIT has the following roadmap to support the same features as the CD-HIT
command line:

- [x] CD-HIT with default parameters.
- [x] Sequence identity threshold parameter (`-c`).
- [ ] Local sequence identity mode (`-G 0`, additional parameters `-aL`, `-AL`, `-aS`, `-AS`).
- [ ] Extended parameter support.
- [ ] CD-HIT-EST.
- [ ] CD-HIT-2D and CD-HIT-2D-EST.
- [ ] CD-HIT-DIV
- [ ] CD-HIT-454

## 🔧 Installing

PyCDHIT can be installed directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycdhit/),
which hosts some pre-built wheels for common architectures & operating systems,
as well as the code required to compile from source with Cython:
```console
$ pip install pycdhit
```

<!-- PyCDHIT is also available as a [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
package:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda pycdhit
```

Otherwise, have a look at the [Installation page](https://pycdhit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/install.html) 
of the [online documentation](https://pycdhit.readthedocs.io/) -->

## 💡 Example

Let's create some sequences in memory, then cluster them with CD-HIT and default 
parameter, and finally print result:

```python
import pycdhit

sequences = [
  "MKALIVLGLVLLSVTVQGKVFERCELARTLKRLGMDGYRGISLANWMCLAKWESGYNTRATNYNAGDRSTDYGIFQINSRYWCNDGKTPGAVNACHLSCSALLQDNIADAVACAKRVVRDPQGIRAWVAWRNRCQNRDVRQYVQGCGV",

  "MMRFVPLFLACISLPAFQATEFTKCEVSHAIEDMDGYQGISLLEWTCVLFHTSGYDSQAIVKNNGSTEYGLFQISNRNWCKSSEFPESENICDISCDKFLDDELADDIVCAKKIVAIKGIDYWKAHKPMCSEKLEQWRCEKPGAPALVVPALNSETPVP",

]

clustering = pycdhit.cluster(sequences)
print("clusters: ", list(clustering.clusters))
print("representatives: ", list(clustering.representatives))
```

This should output the following:
```
clusters: [0, 0, 1, 2]
representatives: [0, 2, 3]
```
i.e. the first two sequences belong to the same cluster (with representative being sequence #0)
while the two remaining ones form a singleton each. The format is similar to 
flat clusters returned by e.g. [`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.18.0/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster.html#fcluster)

## 🔎 See Also

Using CD-HIT to cluster protein families? Then perhaps for the next steps you 
may be interested in aligning them, for instance with 
[`pyfamsa`](https://github.com/althonos/pyfamsa), a Python package wrapping
the [FAMSA 2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.15.664876v1) aligner. 
Then you may want to build a profile HMM from the alignment, for instance 
with [`pyhmmer`](https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer), a Python package 
which wraps [HMMER](http://hmmer.org/).
